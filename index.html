                      <blockquote>My first interaction with Abhilash was on a project that was in a critical stage. Abhilash's calm and measured approach to handling the crisis-like situation impressed me the most. He took charge and completed the design deliverables within time with high quality. Over the period of last 2 years or so, I have had the privilege to observe Abhilash's deliverables and approach to design work from the close quarters and i only have the positive things to say about what I saw. He is a high skilled designer. Product Design is an area where Abhilash is uniquely talented and something he loves doing. He is inherently curious and questions things and in the process of doing so, builds his knowledge and adds value to the product simultaneously. In the various presentations he delivered on his design options, I could see the user empathy being at the center of the conversation. He is highly respected for his work and I would highly recommend him.

                        problem solver. I recommend him highly – he will not let you down!

                      <blockquote>Abhilash was my product designer at Citrix. We worked together on multiple features where Abhilash was tasked with designing the wireframes. Abhilash is always full of innovative ideas around product design. He always looks at ways to include popular UI elements in every design. He also is quite persuasive in pushing his ideas and is willing to root for what he believes in. He is always ready to help clear any last minute UI issues even if it means he has to stretch a bit. In the end he is a great team player.

It has been a pleasure working with Abhilash.
